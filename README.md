# Student Retention and Graduation Rate Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes student retention and graduation rates using a dataset from the higher education sector. The goal is to identify key factors influencing student graduation and develop predictive models to help universities improve student success. The analysis includes data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling using various machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
## Data
The dataset used in this analysis is available in the repository as:
- [`COLLEGE_RET_SV (3).xlsx`](COLLEGE_RET_SV (3).xlsx)  
The dataset contains information about students, including:
- Age
- Gender
- GPA
- Credits Earned
- Financial Aid
- Enrollment Status
- Graduation Status (Target Variable)

## Key Questions
1. What factors most influence whether a student graduates?
2. Can we accurately predict graduation status using this data?

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration**: Initial analysis of dataset structure and distributions
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, feature engineering
3. **Model Building**: Implementation of various models including:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting
   - XGBoost
   - Neural Networks
4. **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Key Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - tensorflow
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook jagadeeshwariFinalTechnicalReport.ipynb`

## Results
The analysis provides insights into factors affecting student graduation and evaluates the performance of different predictive models. Key findings and visualizations are included in the notebook.
