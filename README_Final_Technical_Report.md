# Final Technical Report – Predictive Modeling

This repository contains the final technical report for a predictive modeling project developed using Python. The analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook and includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and recommendations.

## 📘 Notebook

- `jagadeeshwariFinalTechnicalReport (1).ipynb` – A complete end-to-end technical report in Jupyter Notebook format.

## 📊 Key Components

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Classification Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Deep Neural Network
- Model Performance Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
- Visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

## 🛠️ How to Run

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install notebook pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost tensorflow
```

Then launch the notebook with:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
